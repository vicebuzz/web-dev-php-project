## ABOUT OUR SITE

Our site is a simplified example of the requirements of the assignment brief, offering the functionality for users to register, sign in, and populate their account with joined activities from a database for the sports management website. Administrators can also login and create and publish activities to the database, which can then be joined by the generic users. Admins can also update existing activity information to incorporate last minute changes (i.e., a room change). All users can update their account data and also search through all activities hosted by the website.

## LOGIN DETAILS

Here are some sample login details for the website:

**Generic User**
- **USERNAME:** Wilhaz
- **PASSWORD:** webdev

**Admin User**
- **USERNAME:** 
- **PASSWORD:** 

You can also create your own user account, should you wish to, using our "Register" form which will give you standard user privileges.
